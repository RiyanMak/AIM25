## AI-Based System for Early Detection of Neurological Disorders via Facial Expression Analysis

### Project Overview
NeuroCam is an innovative AI-powered system designed to aid in the early detection of neurological disorders through real-time analysis of facial expressions and micro-movements. By leveraging advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, NeuroCam aims to provide an accessible, non-invasive screening tool that can identify subtle facial cues associated with various neurological conditions.


#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/AIM25.git
   cd AIM25
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install (The dependencies)
   ```

3. For Google Colab users:
   - Mount your Google Drive
   - Clone the repository to your drive
   - Follow the collaboration workflow below

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Pull latest changes before starting work**:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for your feature**:
   ```
   git checkout -b [member-name]/[feature-name]
   ```

3. **Save your Colab notebooks** to your personal directory within the `notebooks` folder

4. **Commit and push your changes regularly**:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin [your-branch-name]
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** when your feature is complete and ready for review

6. **Review others' Pull Requests** and provide constructive feedback

7. **Merge to main** after receiving approval from at least one other team member

8. **Download Dependecies** Have python 3.9.13 as your primary python version
   - If you are using venv use pip install -r requirements.txt
   - if you are using conda use conda install --file requirements.txt (you might run into errors so install pip and the do pip install -r requirements.txt)
